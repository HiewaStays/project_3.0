            Nestled in the heart of the Eastern Ghats, Hiewa Stays & Trails was born from a passion for the untouched beauty of Vanjangi Hills. We wanted to create a space where travelers could escape the noise of the city and find a genuine connection with nature and local culture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our mission is to provide an authentic eco-tourism experience that respects the environment and supports the local tribal communities. We believe in sustainable practices, from our building materials to the locally sourced food we serve.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you're here for a breathtaking sunrise trek, a corporate retreat, or simply a quiet weekend away, we invite you to experience the magic of Hiewaâ€”where mountains meet clouds.
